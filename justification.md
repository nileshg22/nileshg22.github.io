#Extra Design Elements 

##Justification for Data Visualization:  In the bio section, I include a visualization in the form of a timeline to display where I’ve lived over time. So, the relationship would be between two types of data, location and time. A timeline effectively demonstrates this relationship. 

##Justification for Data Collection Form: 
In the contact section, I include a form for people to get in touch with me. This form contains 5 fields: name, email, reason for connecting, location, and a general comments section. I chose these fields because the name field is important to see who is writing, the email field helps me reach back, the reason for contact field helps me group reasons to ensure I see recruitment contacts first, and the location field lets me know if I can meet the individual in person over coffee or drinks. I use two different types of fields: text and radio. I also support data validation where I ensure that the fields are not empty and that the email field contains the ‘@‘ sign.
