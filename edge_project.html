    <h1 class="project-title">Canny Edge Detector</h1>
    <h2 class="project-header">Problem:</h2>
    <p class="project-description">I implemented the Canny edge detector, a technique created by
      John Canny to detect a wide range of edges in an image. Canny edge
      detection is very important in image processing because it is able
      to detect edges while suppressing noise and can be tuned through parameters.
    </p>
    <h3 class="project-header">Method:</h3>
    <p class="project-description">Canny edge detection is composed of five steps: Gaussian smoothing,
      calculating the image gradient, suppressing non-maxima, finding two
      thresholds, and edge linking.<br>The first step is image filtering and
      involves creating a gaussian mask which is then convoluted with the grayscale image.<br>
      I then compute the image gradient using the Sobel operators. I create the
      convolution kernels G x and G x and apply them to the filtered image to
      get an enhanced image consisting of the image gradients. I also use the edges
      in an intermediate step to compute θ = tan −1(sobelY /sobelX) in order to
      identify the direction. Next, I use the image gradient and theta values for
      non-maxima suppression. In this method, I look for ridges and keep those
      intensities while zeroing out intensities that do not belong to a ridge.
      A ridge is identified by a pixel that has an intensity greater than its
      two side pixels where its two side pixels are found using the value of θ.
      I use an LUT in order to map the regions based on the value of θ.
      Now, I use thresholding. I find the histogram of the image gradient resulting
      from the non-maxima suppression and then compute the cumulative histogram.
      I then factor in my parameter percentageOfNonEdge to find where I want to
      threshold. I normalize the image gradients to [0,1] so that I can apply
      a ratio which results in the computation of the high threshold.
      The lower threshold is then defined by half of the high threshold.
      Intensities higher than the high threshold are denoted as strong edges.
      Intensities lower than the low threshold are denoted as non-edges and
      suppressed to 0. Intensities between the low and high threshold are denoted
      as weak edges.
      Last I use edge linking to connect strong edges to weak edges if needed.
      I iterate through every pixel and check to see if any of the neighbors are
      strong pixels. If so, then the weak edge is preserved. Otherwise, it is removed.</p>
    <h4 class="project-header">Results:</h4>
    <p class="project-description">Below are the Canny edge detector steps applied to the Lena test image provided.
      The first image, ​figure 1​, is a result of Gaussian Smoothing. We can see that
      this is a blurred version of the original image. Next, we see ​figure 2​,
      the result from computing the image gradients. Here we see that we have
      extracted edges. Next, we use non-maxima suppression, resulting in ​figure 3​,
      a sharper image. Then, double thresholding is used, resulting in
      the weak edges being computes and the strong edges also being computed.
      Last, edge linking is used to connect the strong and weak edges together if
      needed, resulting in the final image displayed in ​figure 5.</p>
